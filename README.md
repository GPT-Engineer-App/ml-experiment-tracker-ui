# ml-experiment-tracker-ui

I want to build an ML experiment tracking UI using MLFlow, similar to W&B / Comel ML, that can be used to track different ML models / datasets / experiments / results per model - accuracy latency perplexity size etc. 

Can you build this, and also provide an example of how to integrate this in ML experiments. Show the steps to run this locally / on cloud
